            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Creating in a mentally stifling time</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">August 9th, 2020 by Gio </p>

            <p>During the era of COVID-19, we are constantly stuck inside, and new experiences have become harder to come by. However, even in the hardest of times, it's still possible to create something new.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Being stuck inside can really be a doozy, but it's important to keep your chin up. While it may seem like everything around you is just shaping up to be the same bland day, it's important to see how each day is unique and each day can call to a unique moment.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Creativity is like a fire, you've got all the elements you need. The paper. The twigs. The driftwood. The pinecones. The logs. The lighter fluid. It's all laying there, waiting to spark up into a beautiful fire, as streaks fly accross the night sky. But... it's just... <strong>NOT.</bold></strong> You pound the log with your fists of fury. You stomp on the logs with all your might. You smash the twigs to shreds. You pour your lighterfluid over the damp newspapers while screaming in anger. <strong> WHY WON'T IT WORK.</strong>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Sometimes, it's just the approach. You've got everything lined up, but all you need is that little <em>spark</em> for your beautiful flame of creativity to light ablaze. </p>
            <h2>Some steps to create your <em>spark</em></h2>
            <p>Below are tips in tricks on how to get started while stuck in a mental block rut.</p>
            <div class = "row mt3">
                <h3 class = "col-7">Create a library of knowledge</h3>
                <img class="col-2" src="https://www.adazing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/open-book-clipart-03.png">
            </div>
                <p>Read, watch movies, go the museum (this may prove challenging at this point in time), go on a hike, the beach, breathe in the fresh air, gain new knowledge online. Just expose yourself to as many things as possible</p>
            <div class = "row mt3">
                <h3 class = "col-7">Connect knowledge and ideas </h3>
                <img class="col-2 mb-2" src="https://www.vippng.com/png/detail/193-1933508_brain-clipart-transparent-background-brain-png.png">
            </div>
            <p>Get all those beautiful new experiences you've had and geoup them together. Brainstorm. What did you like? What didn't you like? Why? What are some things that made you feel happy or sad. Really ask yourself questions into why the epxeriences you had were the way you were, and if you could, what would you do to change them, or make your moments you had better. If you have a solution to problem, that's a great place to begin creating! </p>
            
            <div class = "row mt3">
                <h3 class = "col-7">Form an idea out of your newly found connections </h3>
                <img class="col-2 mb-2" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/e4/92/e9e49227e9c9ab899967e77b5074e773.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>With the new connections and experiences you've had, try to form a concrete idea with them. Doesn't matter if you think the idea sucks, or if it feels like you're copying someone else. In the words of Koci (praise be) <em>"everything is a remix"</em>. Therefore there is no shame in producing something similar to something someone else made. Just don't plagarise. But we are constantly drawing from different sources when we're creating, whether we like it or not</p>
            
            <div class = "row mt3">
                <h3 class = "col-7">Work and rework until you're satisfied with your creation </h3>
                <img class="col-2 mb-2" src="https://cdn.imgbin.com/10/14/20/imgbin-men-at-work-sign-funny-working-s-BieiaAsdurpEuhQ0YQfHeVDwn.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>You're not done yet! Now that you have <em>something</em> there's still much to be done. Keep refining your work. What can you adjust? What can you make better? What new ideas can you come up with out of the ideas you've already made. Don't view this production you've made be the end of your creative endeavour, but rather a springpad for much much more. Just keep working it, and every ounce of sweat your pour in will pay back (in the creative sense) big time! </p>

        <p class = "font-italic mt-3">This piece was inspired by a girl I met while I was in Houston, Texas. Houston was such a terrible place, and the place I least expected to find inspiration. I worked a 9-5 job in an office doing data science for corporate america, and I couldn't have been more miserable. But, in the end, something great came out of my time there.</p>

        <p class = "font-italic mt-3">When I was in Italy, I loved the architecture, but after a while of seeing the same thing over and over again, all of the architecture kind of blended into one. After days of seeing the beauty that is Rome, it became a bit dull, just because I had become so used to it. This is a tour of Rome from the perspective of a tourist who's eyes are glossed over.</p>
